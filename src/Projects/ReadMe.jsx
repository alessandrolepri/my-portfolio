            READ-ME is an app for both writers and readers
            which helps to share your favourite stories.This app is a SQL
            database written with Python and React that can help you lay the
            groundwork for your story, and organising all of your novelâ€™s major
            events. By using Reddit APIs, we worked on our join tables and
            relationships to provide an excellent experience for all our
            users.We split front- end and back-end tasks, and my main focus was
            on the security and auth session, which I tested using Insomnia.
            Once completed, I worked on the front-end building the navbar,
            sidebar, loading page, and authentication managing to set up the
            reset password path for the users.
